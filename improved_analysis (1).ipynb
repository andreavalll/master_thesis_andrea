        "Out of all the stereotypes, 6 (\"Women are weak\") is the only one that starts off with a neutral association. The base word \"weak” is almost perfectly neutral (0.0001), but when put into context, most of the sentences point toward a feminine association, even if it's mild—especially “needed help with heavy bags”, which scores −0.0138.\n",
        "\n",
        "The stereotype with the strongest female score is 7 (\"Women are beautiful\"), with the word “beautiful” at −0.1739, meaning that its representation in vector space is very close to that of “she”. Most of the other sentences in this group also show moderate female associations. Notably, “took care of her looks” scores −0.1139—but it does include the pronoun “her”, which may influence the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next is Stereotype 5 (\"Women are social\"), which has the second highest overall female score, with “social” at −0.1026. Surprisingly, when we test this stereotype in context, the association becomes more mixed. Sentences like “likes small talk” and “likes to work in groups” actually have positive scores, suggesting a mild male alignment. That said, other phrases like “wanted to make more friends” and “is communicative” still show a mild female association, which suggests the stereotype holds to some extent, but is more context-dependent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stereotype 1 (\"Women are emotional and irrational\") is a mixed case. The base phrase “emotional and irrational” is slightly female-associated (−0.0475), but phrases like “overreacted” and “used to cry every night” surprisingly lean male (0.0293 and 0.0322), while “the breakup has been hard on” is essentially neutral. This shows that the model might not encode this stereotype as strongly or consistently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stereotype 2 is also unexpected. While the stereotype itself “gentle, kind, and submissive” is weakly female-associated (−0.0385), phrases like “had to obey” (0.0721) and “always played by the rules” (0.0878) lean male.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stereotype 3 (\"Women are empathetic and caring\") shows a moderate female association overall, especially in “offered a supportive ear” (−0.0909) and “hosted a charity fundraiser” (−0.0628). But interestingly, “was very nurturing” is close to neutral (0.0138), suggesting that not all empathy-related expressions are close to \"women\" in vector space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stereotype 4 mostly aligns with a mild female association. The clearest examples are “folded the laundry” and “wishes for a tidy house”, both scoring around −0.06."
